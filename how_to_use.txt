#1 Input: .txt file with copying parameters

#2 Copying parameters:
	- Ask user for source file to copy (source)
	- Ask user where to make the new folder (destination)
	- Ask user for naming convention for corresponding new folder/file name (create)

#3 The resulting folder(s) would copy the .vca file and do the following:
	- Create a new folder with the user input's file naming convention
	- Update the .vca file name with the user input

#4 Loops over x amount of times for each copy


**** update_vca.py will need to be used to update video file paths inside .vca file ****


Observations:
if random destination is inputted, this makes a copy of the original file and renames it as that. Additionally, it saves it to the folder containing the .py file
